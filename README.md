# The *canAI*.. module 
### (pronouced "Can I...") -  This library (or file, really), allows for an intutive call to get an example of, well, whatever you need for testing, or debugging, etc.  

## Disclaimer: 
I make zero assertions as to the veracity or completeness of these lists of things; they are just for testing.  

## These lists of data are:
* Generated from Artificial Inteligence prompts (hence the "**AI**" in the name)
* Sometimes adult or sassy in nature
* Not to be taken seriously, or used in production code
* May change at **any** time.

## Usage
An instance of "Nouns" called "canAI" (pronounced "*Can I..*").  It has one method called "getA()", to which you pass a known **noun** from the structor class.

| Spoken English | Javascript | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Can I get a dog name? | ``canAI.getA("dogName");`` | "Fido" |
| Can I get a publicly shamed comedian? | ``canAI.getA( "publiclyShamedComedian" );`` | "Lenny Bruce" |
| Can I get an Adventure Time character? | ``canAI.getA("adventureTimeChar");`` | "Lumpy Space Princess" |

#### Note:  If you use one of these in your code, **_kindly suggest new lists_** in the comments section of github, so the file will grow and be more awesome!!  :-)  P.S. I also love github stars, just sayin.
